The asset paths are just explicit in that.\n\nWhat asset paths are you using?\n\n* ‚úÖ Fully relative `url(./foo.png)` or `url(foo.png)`\n* ‚ùå Root relative `url(/foo.png)`\n* ‚ùå Relative to some package or webpack root `url(~stuff/foo.png`)\n* ‚ùå Relative to some variable which is your single asset directory `url($variable/foo.png)`\n\nWhat webpack errors are you getting?\n\n* ‚úÖ Webpack can't find the relative asset `foo.png` üòû\n* ‚ùå Webpack says it doesn't have a loader for `fully/resolved/path/foo.png` üòï\n\nIf you can tick at least 1 item in **all of these questions** then use this loader. It will allow webpack to find assets with **fully relative paths**.\n\nIf for any question you can't tick _any_ items then webpack should be able to already find your assets. You don't need this loader. ü§∑\n\nOnce webpack resolves your assets (even if it complains about loading them) then this loading is working correctly. üëç\n\n## What's the problem with SASS?\n\nWhen you use **fully relative paths** in `url()` statements then Webpack expects to find those assets next to the root SCSS file, regardless of where you specify the `url()`.\n\nTo illustrate here are 3 simple examples of SASS and Webpack _without_ `resolve-url-loader`.\n\n[![the basic problem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bholloway/resolve-url-loader/v5/packages/resolve-url-loader/docs/basic-problem.svg)](docs/basic-problem.svg)\n\nThe first 2 cases are trivial and work fine. The asset is specified in the root SCSS file and Webpack finds it.\n\nBut any practical SASS composition will have nested SCSS files, as in the 3rd case. Here Webpack cannot find the asset.\n\n```\nModule not found: Can't resolve './cool.png' in '/absolute/path/.../my-project/src/styles.scss'\n```\n\nThe path we present to Webpack really needs to be `./subdir/cool.png` but we don't want to write that in our SCSS. üòí\n\nLuckily we can use `resolve-url-loader` to do the **url re-writing** and make it work. üòäüéâ\n\nWith functions and mixins and multiple nesting it gets more complicated. Read more detail in [how the loader works](docs/how-it-works.md). ü§ì\n\n## Getting started\n\n> **Upgrading?** the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) shows how to migrate your webpack config.\n\n### Install\n\nvia npm\n\n```bash\nnpm install resolve-url-loader --save-dev\n```\n\nvia yarn\n\n```bash\nyarn add resolve-url-loader --dev\n```\n\n### Configure Webpack\n\nThe typical use case is `resolve-url-loader` between `sass-loader` and `css-loader`.\n\n**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**\n* **source-maps required** for loaders preceding `resolve-url-loader` (regardless of `devtool`).\n* Always use **full loader package name** (don't omit `-loader`) otherwise you can get errors that are hard to debug.\n\n\n``` javascript\nrules: [\n  {\n    test: /\\.scss$/,\n    use: [\n      ...\n      {\n        loader: 'css-loader',\n        options: {...}\n      }, {\n        loader: 'resolve-url-loader',\n        options: {...}\n      }, {\n        loader: 'sass-loader',\n        options: {\n          sourceMap: true, // <-- !!IMPORTANT!!\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  ...\n]\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThe loader should work without options but use these as required.\n\n| option      | type     |
